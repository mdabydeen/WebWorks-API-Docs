* @toc {User Identity} User Identity 
* @BB10X
* @namespace The User Identity object contains information regarding the user&apos;s identity and accounts on a BlackBerry smartphone.
*
* <h3>Identity Service SDK Overview - interfaces for using Identity
* Services from 3rd Party applications</h3><br />
*
* <p><b>What functionality does this Identity Service SDK provide to apps?</b>
*
* <p>This SDK provides a series of functions that enable an application to choose an
* identity provider(s) for their application, and to request authentication tokens
* from that provider, as well as information about the user.
*
* <p>At present, the only Identity Provider available is BlackBerry ID. As more
* identity providers become available, this SDK will provide access to those
* providers.
*
*
* <p><b>Why integrate with Identity Service?</b>
*
* <p>If your app needs to interact with an off-device service that requires user
* authentication, you can integrate with Identity Service to provide seamless
* access to the off-device service. The interaction from the app to the off-device
* service is 'seamless' because the user is not prompted within the app for the
* username and password required by the off-device service. Instead, BlackBerry ID
* can pass back a 'token' that authenticates the user's identity, and that token
* can be read and understood by the off-service device, thus allowing the user
* access to that off-device content WITHOUT requiring user interaction for
* authentication.
*
* <p><b>Fictitious Example</b>: Imagine an app called 'MyPics' that has a user's
* photo content stored off-device, and the content is accessible from the web and
* from BlackBerry devices. If 'MyPics' is integrated with BlackBerry ID
* (i.e. we've created a token specifically for them), the app can request a token
* from BlackBerry ID to confirm the user's identity. The app can send that token
* to the off-device content service for 'MyPics', as a way of 'signing in' that
* user to their MyPics account WITHOUT requiring the user to enter a username and
* password within the 'MyPics' app. The result is a seamless user experience for
* the app; the user will get their photos on the device without having to sign in
* to the 'MyPics' service. Since they are already signed in to their device with
* their BlackBerry ID, and since the app is integrated with BlackBerry ID to use
* tokens, it all happens without any user annoyance of being prompted to 'sign in'
* to MyPics.
*
* <p>Even if your app doesn't need to communicate with off-device services using
* tokens, there are other useful APIs in this SDK that provide access the user's
* account information (first name, last name, screen name, or username).
*
* <p>The next section provides a more detailed technical overview of the APIs that
* provide this functionality.<br />
*
*
* <p><b>Identity Service SDK functionality - API overview</b>
*
* <p>This Identity Service WebWorks SDK provides an interface for applications to make
* use of BlackBerry ID functionality from within their app.
*
* <p>The APIs provided in this SDK enable apps to do the following:
* - retrieve the account information of the user who is signed in with their
* BlackBerry ID on the BB10 device. The API <b>getProperties()</b> can be
* used to retrieve the user's first name, last name, username, and screenname.
*
* <p>- retrieve tokens that prove the user's identity for off-device services
* <i>(known as 'relying parties', because they are <b>relying</b> on BlackBerry ID
* to confirm the user's identity)</i>, so that the user can have seamless access
* to that off-device service without being required to enter their username and
* password. These tokens are used by the off-device service (relying party) to
* confirm the identity of the user. <b>NOTE: The APIs <b>getToken()</b> and
* <b>clearToken()</b> can only be used if the relying party has gone through
* integration process with RIM to have tokens defined for that relying party.</b>
*
* <p>- for background services where it doesn't make sense to show any screens to the
* user (i.e. background services that do not have any UI), suppress the ability
* for the Identity Service to pop up an authentication/password confirmation
* dialog box. The API <b>setOption()</b> is provided to ensure that the
* Identity Service does not present a pop up screen for authentication/password
* verification within background services where that wouldn't make sense.
*
* <p><b>Important</b>: There is never a need for an application to present a
* "sign in" screen to the user. All the IDS APIs listed above will check to see if
* their is a BlackBerry ID associated with the device, and if there isn't one,
* they will pop an authentication (sign in) screen on the device (unless the
* calling app runs in the background and has 'set_GUI_allowed = False' to
* specifically prevent this from happening.)
*
* <p><b>About Callback functions</b>
*
* <p>Several IDS APIs have the following 2 parameters:
* -    Success callback function
* -    Failure callback function
*
* <p>The Identity Service responds asynchronously to API calls made by an
* application. Upon detection of a response, the IDS library will parse the
* response (which will either be success or failure), and invoke the corresponding
* callback function that the app has provided for the success or failure case.
*
* <p>So the callback functions are a mechanism for IDS library to pass the parsed
* response from the daemon back to the calling application. The callback functions
* cannot be NULL; the app must specify what to do in both the success and failure
* scenarios.
*
* <p><b>Integrating an application with IDS APIs</b>
*
*
* <p>The calling app uses the function <b>registerProvider()</b> which will
* connect the app to an Identity Service. This step must be done
* <i>before</i> the app calls any of the IDS APIs described above
* (getToken(), clearToken(), etc). After the app makes an API call to
* one of the IDS APIs listed above (i.e. getToken), the IDS library will
* asynchronously process that request, and call the success/failure callback provided.
*
* @featureID blackberry.user.identity
* @permission access_bbid_pii Permits your app to access user identity information.

 * <p>Option to set whether or not GUI allowed flag is set.  Value is "true" or
 * "false".  By default, in cases where user input is required, the Identity
 * Service performs the user interaction on behalf of the calling
 * application.  If this has been set to false, and user input is required,
 * the API will return an error.  If no user interaction is required to
 * complete the API, this setting has no effect.

 * <p> Set the group ID of the calling application for UI dialogs.  String
 * version of UI group id.  This is required in cases where the Identity
 * Service requires user input from the user and must open an interface in
